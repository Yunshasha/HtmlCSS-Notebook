Button:
    Receive keyboard focus by default
    "Click" with the Space key
    Submit form data to a server
    Reset a form
    Be disabled with the disabled attribute
    Instruct a screen reader with the implicit button role
    Show :focus, :hover, :active, :disabled

With a little scripting, a button is the perfect element for:

    Opening a modal window
    Triggering a popup menu
    Toggling an interface
    Playing media content
    Inserting with JS if they only work with JS


Link:
    Create hypertext, a network of online resources
    Navigate the user to a new page or view
    Change the URL
    Cause a browser redraw/refresh
    Support page jumps with internal href attributes
    Deep-link client-rendered applications
    Are focusable by default with the href attribute
    Register a click with the Enter key
    Have the implicit link role
    Can't be disabled like buttons but can be made inert with tabindex="-1" and aria-hidden="true"
    Allow opening in new windows (and back in the day, framesets)
    Show :link, :visited, :focus, :hover, :active
